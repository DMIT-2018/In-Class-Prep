In-Class-Prep
=============

## Organization

In this repo, I will be using two or three core folders to hold information

- **Ad-Hoc** - Assorted solutions/demos are placed here
- **eRestaurant** - The main demo used through the course
- **notes** *optional* - A place to drop notes and other [detritus](https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=detritus)

In addition, I plan on tagging certain commits as being "end-points" of a demo for a specific topic.

## Useful git Commands

- `git tag` - lists the tags
- `git tag -a v.3.2 -m "Comment on tag"` - create a tag
- `git push --tags` - push tags to the repo
